# Pedometer_GPS
Android app built in ECE-155 Embedded Systems course to track and guide the user through a map

Lab 0 - 3
Uses a low pass filter to read accurate data from the accelerometer and count steps based on a pattern in the data.

Lab 4
Builds on the previous labs by adding a map and implementing a simple path finding algorithm to guide the user
between two points on the map by drawing vectors.
